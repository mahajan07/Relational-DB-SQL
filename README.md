# Relational Database & SQL Project
## We can use Mysql, SQL Server, SQLite, Oracle for Database design and querying.


# Introduction to Relational Database and SQL
## For work and practice in MYSQL Workbench
### [Project Structure 1](https://github.com/mahajan07/Relational-DB-SQL/blob/main/workbook.sql)
## For work and practice in MYSQL Workbench
#### Task 1: Know what tables are and write basic SELECT statements.
#### Task 2: Use wildcard characters for pattern matching, and sort query results.
#### Task 3: Add data to a database with INSERT statements.
#### Task 4: Delete data from a database with DELETE statements.
#### Task 5: Join tables together to produce meaningful reports.


# Build a Database from a Relational Model
## For work and practice in SQLite Studio
### [Project Structure 2](https://github.com/mahajan07/Relational-DB-SQL/blob/main/Building%20DB/VentureOut.db)

#### Task 1: The Relational Model - You will review the components in the relational model and use the SQLiteStudio graphical user interface (GUI) to create a database.
#### Task 2: Build a table with the GUI - Using the SQLiteStudio GUI, you will build two of the tables displayed on the relational model.
#### Task 3: Build a table with SQL code. - You will write SQL code to generate two more of the five tables on the relational model.
#### Task 4: The Combination Key - You will build the last table in the database as you explore two methods of creating combination keys.
#### Task 5: Test Data - In preparation for writing queries to test the database design, you will populate the tables with data while maintaining common data values for the common columns that relate tables.
#### Task 6: Test the Design - To validate the relational model database design, you will write and run a series of queries.
