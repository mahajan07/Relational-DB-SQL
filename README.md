## Build a Database from a Relational Model
## For work and practice in SQLite Studio

#### Task 1: The Relational Model - You will review the components in the relational model and use the SQLiteStudio graphical user interface (GUI) to create a database.
#### Task 2: Build a table with the GUI - Using the SQLiteStudio GUI, you will build two of the tables displayed on the relational model.
#### Task 3: Build a table with SQL code. - You will write SQL code to generate two more of the five tables on the relational model.
#### Task 4: The Combination Key - You will build the last table in the database as you explore two methods of creating combination keys.
#### Task 5: Test Data - In preparation for writing queries to test the database design, you will populate the tables with data while maintaining common data values for the common columns that relate tables.
#### Task 6: Test the Design - To validate the relational model database design, you will write and run a series of queries.
